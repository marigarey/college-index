# college-index
if Wikipedia was a cheat sheet for college applications

This is my first ever full project from scratch with PHP, 
I did experiment with object oriented programming, 
but other than that this code is pretty messy

my teacher told us that he didn't
teach us how to write the best looking code

my goal is to make this project look better :)
